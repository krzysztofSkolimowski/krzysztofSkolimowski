### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Call me Chris! I am a software engineer and a Gopher from Poland. I have a passion for technology, particularly the Web. I specialize in backend development, but I also enjoy understanding how the whole project works. 

I enjoy spending my time coding and experimenting. This is my space to share my projects. Please take a look around!
