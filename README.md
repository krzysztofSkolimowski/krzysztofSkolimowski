### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, my name is Krzysiu, but you can call me Chris. I am a software engineer and a Gopher from Poland. I have a passion for technology, particularly the Web. I specialize in backend development, but I also enjoy understanding how the whole project works. I appreciate a pragmatic approach to programming and view technology as a solution to specific problems, rather than an end in itself.


I enjoy spending my time coding new projects, experimenting with different solutions, and hacking on existing ones. This is my space to share those projects with others. Please take a look around!
